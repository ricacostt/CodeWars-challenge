ðŸ‘‰ Istructions:

You are approaching a door that requires a passcode. This pin can be found from two different arrays, taking one digit from each.
The clue provided to you states that the two arrays have one digit in common. The digits needed to calculate the passcode are one index prior to the common digit.
Return the sum of the two digits.

ðŸ‘‰ For example:

If you have arrays of [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ] and [ 9, 8, 7, 6, 5], the pin numbers will be 4 and 6, both one index before the common number 5. The return would be 10.
